# How to create a new mobile service

This topic shows you how to use the [Azure Management Portal][Management Portal] to create a new JavaScript backend in Azure Mobile Services, which uses JavaScript for server-side business logic. To create both the mobile service backend and a mobile client app that consumes the new mobile service, you should instead see [Get started with Mobile Services].

>[AZURE.NOTE]To complete this tutorial, you need an Azure account that has the Azure Mobile Services feature enabled. If you don't have an account, you can create a trial account in just a couple of minutes. For details, see <a href="/pricing/1rmb-trial/">Azure Trial</a>.
