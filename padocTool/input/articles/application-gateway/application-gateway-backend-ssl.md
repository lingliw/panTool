# Enabling SSL Policy and end to end SSL on Application Gateway

## Overview

Application gateway supports SSL termination at the gateway, after which traffic typically flows unencrypted to the backend servers. This allows web servers to be unburdened from costly encryption/decryption overhead. However for some customers unencrypted communication to the backend servers is not an acceptable option. This could be due to security/compliance requirements or the application may only accept secure connection. For such applications, application gateway now supports end to end SSL encryption.

End to end SSL allows you to securely transmit sensitive data to the backend encrypted while availing benefits of Layer 7 load balancing features which application gateway provides, such as cookie affinity, URL-based routing, support for routing based on sites or ability to inject X-Forwarded-* headers.

When configured with end to end SSL communication mode, application gateway terminates user SSL sessions at the gateway and decrypts user traffic. It then applies the configured rules to select an appropriate backend pool instance to route traffic to. Application gateway then initiates a new SSL connection to the backend server and re-encrypts data using backend server's public key certificate before transmitting request to the backend. End to end SSL is enabled by setting protocol setting in BackendHTTPSetting to Https, which is then applied to a backend pool. Each backend server in the backend pool with end to end SSL enabled must be configured with a certificate to allow secure communication.

In this example, requests for https://contoso.com can be routed to ContosoServerPool over HTTP, and https://fabrikam.com will be routed to FabrikamServerPool over HTTPS using end to end SSL.

## End to end SSL and white listing of certificates

Application gateway only communicates with known backend instances, which have whitelisted their certificate with the application gateway. To enable whitelisting of certificates, you must upload the public key of backend server certificates to the application gateway. Only connections to known and white listed backend is then allowed and remaining result in a gateway error. Self-signed certificates are for test purposes only and not recommended for production workloads. Such certificates must also be white listed with the application gateway as described above before they can be used.

## Application Gateway SSL Policy

Application gateway also supports user configurable SSL negotiation policies, which allow customers finer grained control over SSL connections at the application gateway.

1. SSL 2.0 and 3.0 are forced disabled for all Application Gateways. They are not configurable at all.
2. SSL policy definition gives you option to disable any of the following 3 protocols - TLSv1_0, TLSv1_1, TLSv1_2.
3. If no SSL policy is defined all three (TLSv1_0, TLSv1_1, TLSv1_2) would be enabled.

## Next steps

After learning about end to end SSL and SSL policy, go to [enable end to end SSL on application gateway](/documentation/articles/application-gateway-end-to-end-ssl-powershell/) to create an application gateway with ability to send traffic to backend in encrypted form.
