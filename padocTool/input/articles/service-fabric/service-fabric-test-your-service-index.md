# Test a Service Fabric service
Testability is a suite of tools specifically designed for testing your services built on Microsoft Azure Service Fabric. The tools allow you to easily induce meaningful faults and run test scenarios to exercise and validate the numerous different states and transitions your services will experience throughout their lifetimes, all in a controlled and safe manner.
