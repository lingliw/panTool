##Overview

In Media Services a media processor is a component that handles a specific processing task, such as encoding, format conversion, encrypting, or decrypting media content. You typically create a media processor when you are creating a task to encode, encrypt, or convert the format of media content.

The following table provides the name and description of each available media processor.

Media Processor Name|Description|More Information
---|---|---
Azure Media Encoder|Lets you run encoding tasks using the Azure Media Encoder.|[Azure Media Encoder](/documentation/articles/media-services-encode-asset#azure_media_encoder)
Media Encoder Standard|Lets you run encoding tasks using the Media Encoder Standard.|[Azure Media Encoder](/documentation/articles/media-services-encode-asset#media_encoder_standard)
Media Encoder Premium Workflow|Lets you run encoding tasks using Media Encoder Premium Workflow.|[Media Encoder Premium Workflow](/documentation/articles/media-services-encode-asset#media_encoder_premium_wokrflow)
Azure Media Indexer| Enables you to make media files and content searchable, as well as generate closed captioning tracks and keywords.|[Indexing Media Files with Azure Media Indexer](/documentation/articles/media-services-index-content).
Azure Media Hyperlapse (preview)|Enables you to smooth out the "bumps" in your video with video stabilization. Also allows you to speed up your content into a consumable clip.|		[Azure Media Hyperlapse](http://azure.microsoft.com/blog/?p=286281&preview=1&_ppp=61e1a0b3db)</a>
Storage Decryption| Lets you decrypt media assets that were encrypted using storage encryption.|N/A
Windows  Azure Media Packager|Lets you convert media assets from .mp4 to smooth streaming format. Also, lets you convert media assets from smooth streaming to the Apple HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) format.|[Task Preset Strings for the Azure Media Packager](http://msdn.microsoft.com/zh-cn/library/hh973635.aspx)
Windows  Azure Media Encryptor|Lets you encrypt media assets using PlayReady Protection.|[Task Preset Strings for the Azure Media Packager](http://msdn.microsoft.com/zh-cn/library/hh973610.aspx)

##Get MediaProcessor

The following method shows how to get a media processor instance. The code example assumes the use of a module-level variable named **_context** to reference the server context as described in the section [How to: Connect to Media Services Programmatically].

	private static IMediaProcessor GetLatestMediaProcessorByName(string mediaProcessorName)
	{
	     var processor = _context.MediaProcessors.Where(p => p.Name == mediaProcessorName).
	        ToList().OrderBy(p => new Version(p.Version)).LastOrDefault();
	
	    if (processor == null)
	        throw new ArgumentException(string.Format("Unknown media processor", mediaProcessorName));
	
	    return processor;
	}
