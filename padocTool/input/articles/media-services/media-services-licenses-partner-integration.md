#Using partners to deliver Widevine licenses to Azure Media Services

##Overview

Windows Azure Media Services enables you to deliver MPEG-DASH protected with Widevine DRM, which is encrypted per the Common Encryption (CENC) specification.

>[AZURE.NOTE] Currently, Media Services does not provide a Widevine license server. You can use the following AMS partners to help you deliver Widevine licenses: [EZDRM](http://ezdrm.com/), [castLabs](http://castlabs.com/company/partners/azure/)

##castLabs

You can use [castLabs](http://castlabs.com/company/partners/azure/) to deliver Widevine licenses. For more information, see [Using castLabs to deliver DRM licenses to Azure Media Services](/documentation/articles/media-services-castlabs-integration)
