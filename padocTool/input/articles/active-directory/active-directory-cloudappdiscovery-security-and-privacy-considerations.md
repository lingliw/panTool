# Cloud App Discovery Security and Privacy Considerations

Microsoft is committed to protecting your privacy and securing your data, while delivering software and services that help you manage the security of your organization. <br>
We recognize that when you entrust your data to others, that trust requires rigorous security engineering investments and expertise to back it. 
Microsoft adheres to strict compliance and security guidelines from secure software development lifecycle practices to operating a service. <br>
Securing and protecting data is a top priority at Microsoft. 

This topic explains how data is collected, processed, and secured within Azure Active Directory Cloud App Discovery




##Overview

Cloud App Discovery is a feature of Azure AD and is hosted in Windows Azure. <br>
Cloud App Discovery endpoint agents are used to collect application discovery data from IT managed machines. <br> 
The collected data is sent securely over an encrypted channel to the Azure AD Cloud App Discovery service. <br>
The Cloud App Discovery data for an organization is then visible in the Azure portal.

The following sections follow the flow of information and describe how it is secured as it moves from your organization to the Cloud App Discovery service and ultimately to the Cloud App Discovery portal.



## Collecting data from your organization

In order to use Azure Active Directory’s Cloud App discovery feature to get insights into the applications used by employees in your organization, you need to first deploy Azure AD Cloud App Discovery endpoint agents to machines in your organization.

Administrators of the Azure Active Directory tenant (or their delegate) can download the agent installation package from the Azure portal. The agents can either be manually installed or installed across multiple machines in the organization using SCCM or Group Policy.

For further instructions on deployment options, see [Cloud App Discovery Group Policy Deployment Guide](http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/30965.cloud-app-discovery-group-policy-deployment-guide.aspx).


### Data collected by the agent

The information outlined in the list below is collected by the agent when connections are made to Web applications. The information is only collected for those applications that the administrator has configured for application discovery. <br>
The list of applications that you choose to collect metadata for is configurable in the portal, under the Settings tab.

**Information Category**: User information <br>
**Description**: <br>
The Windows user name of the process that made a request to the target Web application (e.g.: DOMAIN\username) as well as the Windows Security Identifier (SID) of the user.


**Information Category**: Process information <br>
**Description**: <br>
The name of the process that made the request to the target web application (e.g.: “iexplore.exe”)

**Information Category**: Machine information <br>
**Description**: <br>
The machine NetBIOS name on which the agent is installed. 

**Information Category**: App traffic information <br>
**Description**: <br>

The following connection information:

- The source (local computer) and destination IP addresses and port numbers 

- The public IP address of the organization through which the request goes out.

- The time of the request 

- The volume of traffic sent and received 

- The IP version (4 or 6) 

- For TLS connections only: The target host name from either the Server Name Indication extension or the server certificate. 

The following HTTP information:

- Method (GET, POST, etc.) 

- Protocol (HTTP/1.1, etc.) 

- User agent string 

- Hostname 

- Target URI (excluding query string) 

- Content type information 

- Referrer URL information (excluding query string)



> [AZURE.NOTE] The HTTP information above is collected for all non-encrypted connections. 
 For TLS connections, this information is only captured when the ‘Deep Inspection’ setting is turned on in the portal. The setting is ‘ON’ by default.
For more details, see [Getting Started With Cloud App Discovery](http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/30962.getting-started-with-cloud-app-discovery.aspx)
 

 
### How the agent works

The agent installation includes two components:

- A user-mode component

- A kernel-mode driver component (Windows Filter Platform driver)



When the agent is first installed it stores a machine-specific trusted certificate on the machine which it then uses to establish a secure connection with the Cloud App Discovery service. <br> 
The agent periodically retrieves policy configuration from the Cloud App Discovery service over this secure connection. <br>
The policy includes information about which cloud applications to monitor and whether auto-updating should be enabled, among other things.

As Web traffic is sent and received on the machine, Cloud App Discovery analyzes the traffic and extracts the relevant metadata (see the table above). <br>
Every minute, the agent uploads the collected metadata to the Cloud App Discovery service over an encrypted channel.

For encrypted connections, an additional step is performed in an effort to improve the accuracy of the collected data.<br>
This is known as deep inspection. <br>
The driver component intercepts the encrypted traffic and inserts itself into the encrypted stream. 
It does this by creating a self-signed root certificate on the machine causing the client application to trust the Cloud App Discovery agent. This self-signed root certificate is marked non-exportable and is ACL’d to administrators. It is intended to never leave the machine on which it was created.


### Respecting user privacy

Our goal is to provide administrators the tools to set the balance between detailed optics into application usage and user privacy as appropriate for their organization. To that end, we provide the following knobs in the settings page in the Portal:

- **Data Collection**: Administrators can choose to specify which applications or application categories they want to get discovery data on.


- **Deep Inspection**: Administrators can chose to specify if the agent collects HTTP traffic for SSL/TLS connections. 



The Cloud App Discovery endpoint agent only collects the information described in the table above.

## Sending data to Cloud App Discovery

Once metadata has been collected by the agent, it is cached on the machine for up to one minute or until the cached data reaches a size of 5MB. It is then compressed and sent over a secure connection to the Cloud App Discovery service.

If the agent is unable to communicate with the Cloud App Discovery service for any reason, the collected metadata is stored in a local file cache that can only be accessed by privileged users on the machine (such as the Administrators group). <br>
The agent automatically attempts to resend the cached metadata until it has successfully been received by the Cloud App Discovery service.



## Receiving the data at the service end

The agents authenticate to the Cloud App Discovery service using the machine specific client authentication certificate referenced above and forwards data over an encrypted channel. <br>
The Cloud App Discovery service’s analytics pipeline processes metadata for each customer separately by logically partitioning it through all stages of the analytics pipeline. 
The analyzed metadata drives the various reports in the portal. 

The unprocessed metadata and the analyzed metadata are stored for up to 180 days. In addition, customers can choose to capture the analyzed metadata in an Azure blob storage account of their choosing. 
This is useful for offline analysis of metadata as well as longer retention of the data.

## Accessing the data using the Azure portal

In an effort to keep the metadata collected secure, by default only global administrators of the tenant have access to the Cloud App Discovery feature in the Azure portal. <br>
However, administrators can choose to delegate this access to other users or groups.



> [AZURE.NOTE] For more details, see [Getting Started With Cloud App Discovery](http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/30962.getting-started-with-cloud-app-discovery.aspx)
 


Any user accessing the data in the portal, must be licensed with an Azure AD Premium license.
