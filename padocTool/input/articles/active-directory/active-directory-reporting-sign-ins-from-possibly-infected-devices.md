| :-------------     | :-------        |
| <p>Use this report when you want to see sign ins from devices on which some malware (malicious software) may be running. We correlate IP addresses of sign ins against IP addresses from which an attempt was made to contact a malware server.</p><p>Recommendation: Since this report assumes an IP address was associated with the same device in both cases, we recommend that you contact the user and scan the user's device to be certain.</p><p>For more information about how to address malware infections, see the [Malware Protection Center](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=335773). </p> | Directory > Reports tab |
