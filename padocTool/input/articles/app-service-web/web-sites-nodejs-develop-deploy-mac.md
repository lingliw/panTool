This tutorial shows how to create a simple [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) application and deploy it to a [web app](/documentation/articles/app-service-web-overview) in [Azure Websites](/documentation/articles/app-service-value-prop-what-is) by using [Git](http://git-scm.com). The instructions in this tutorial can be followed on any operating system that is capable of running Node.js.

You'll learn:

* How to create a web app in Azure Websites by using the Azure preview portal.
* How to deploy a Node.js application to the web app by pushing to the web app's Git repository.

The completed application writes a short "hello world" string to the browser.

## Create a web app and enable Git publishing

Follow these steps to create a web app in Azure Websites and enable Git publishing. 
<!-- deleted by customization

[Git](http://git-scm.com/%20target="_blank) is a distributed version control system that you can use to deploy your Azure Website. You'll store the code you write for your web app in a local Git repository, and you'll deploy your code to Azure by pushing to a remote repository. This method of deployment is a feature of Azure Websites web apps.  

1. Sign in to the [Azure preview portal](https://manage.windowsazure.cn).

2. Click the **+ NEW** icon on the top left of the portal.

3. Click **Web + Mobile**, and then click **Web app**.

    ![][portal-quick-create]

4. Enter a name for the web app in the **Web app** box.

	This name must be unique in the chinacloudsites.cn domain because the URL of the web app will be {name}.chinacloudsites.cn. If the name you enter isn't unique, a red exclamation mark appears in the text box.

5. Select a **Resource Group** or create a new one.

	For more information about resource groups, see [Using the Azure Preview Portal to manage your Azure resources](/documentation/articles/resource-group-portal).

5. Select an **App Service plan/Location** or create a new one.

	For more information about App Service plans, see [App Service plans overview](/documentation/articles/azure-web-sites-web-hosting-plans-in-depth-overview)

6. Click **Create**.
   
	![][portal-quick-create2]

	In a short time, typically less than a minute, Azure finishes creating the new web app.

7. Click **Web apps > {your new web app}**.

	![](./media/web-sites-nodejs-develop-deploy-mac/gotowebapp.png)

8. In the **Web app** blade, click the **Deployment** part.

	![][deployment-part]

9. In the **Continuous Deployment** blade, click **Choose Source**

14. Click **Local Git Repository**, and then click **OK**.

	![][setup-git-publishing]

11. Set up deployment credentials if you haven't already done so.

	a. In the Web app blade, click **Settings > Deployment credentials**.

	![][deployment-credentials]
 
	b. Create a user name and password. 
	
	![](./media/web-sites-nodejs-develop-deploy-mac/setdeploycreds.png)

11. In the Web app blade, click **Settings**, and then click **Properties**.
 
	To publish, you'll push to a remote Git repository. The URL for the repository is listed under **GIT URL**. You'll use this URL later in the tutorial.

No credit card required, no commitments.

1. Login to the [Azure Management Portal].

2. Click the **+ NEW** icon on the bottom left of the portal

    ![The Azure Management Portal with the +NEW link highlighted.][portal-new-website]

3. Click **WEBSITE**, then **QUICK CREATE**. Enter a value for **URL** and select the datacenter for your website in the **REGION** dropdown. Click the checkmark at the bottom of the dialog.

    ![The Quick Create dialog][portal-quick-create]

4. Once the website status changes to **Running**, click on the name of the website to access the **Dashboard**

	![Open web site dashboard][go-to-dashboard]

6. At the bottom right of the Quickstart page, select **Set up a deployment from source control**.

	![Set up Git publishing][setup-git-publishing]

6. When asked "Where is your source code?" select **Local Git repository**, and then click the arrow.

	![where is your source code][where-is-code]

7. To enable Git publishing, you must provide a user name and password. If you have previously enabled publishing for an Azure Website, you will not be prompted for the user name or password. Instead, a Git repository will be created using the user name and password you previously specified. Make a note of the user name and password, as they will be used for Git publishing to all Azure Websites you create.

	![The dialog prompting for user name and password.][portal-git-username-password]

8. Once the Git repository is ready, you will be presented with instructions on the Git commands to use in order to setup a local repository and then push the files to Azure.

## Build and test your application locally

In this section, you'll create a **server.js** file that contains a slightly modified version of the 'Hello World' example from [nodejs.org]. The code adds process.env.PORT as the port to listen on when running in an Azure web app.

1. Create a directory named *helloworld*.

2. Use a text editor to create a new file named **server.js** in the *helloworld* directory.

2. Copy the following code into the **server.js** file, and then save the file:

        var http = require('http')
        var port = process.env.PORT || 1337;
        http.createServer(function(req, res) {
          res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
          res.end('Hello World\n');
        }).listen(port);

3. Open the command line, and use the following command to start the web app locally.

        node server.js

4. Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:1337. 

	A webpage that displays "Hello World" appears, as shown in the following screenshot.

    ![A browser displaying the 'Hello World' message.][helloworld-localhost]

## Publish your application

1. Install Git if you haven't already done so.

	For installation instructions for your platform, see the [Git download page](http://git-scm.com/download).

1. From the command line, change directories to the **helloworld** directory and enter the following command to initialize a local Git repository.

		git init


2. Use the following commands to add files to the repository:

		git add .
		git commit -m "initial commit"

3. Add a Git remote for pushing updates to the web app that you created previously, by using the following command:

		git remote add azure [URL for remote repository]

4. Push your changes to Azure by using the following command:

		git push azure master

	You are prompted for the password that you created earlier. The output is similar to the following example.

		Counting objects: 3, done.
		Delta compression using up to 8 threads.
		Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.
		Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 374 bytes, done.
		Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
		remote: New deployment received.
		remote: Updating branch 'master'.
		remote: Preparing deployment for commit id '5ebbe250c9'.
		remote: Preparing files for deployment.
		remote: Deploying Web.config to enable Node.js activation.
		remote: Deployment successful.
		To https://user@testsite.scm.chinacloudsites.cn/testsite.git
		 * [new branch]      master -> master

5. To view your app, click the **Browse** button on the **Web App** part in the Azure Management Portal.

-->

## Publish changes to your application

1. Open the **server.js** file in a text editor, and change 'Hello World\n' to 'Hello Azure\n'. 

2. Save the file.

2. From the command line, change directories to the **helloworld** directory and run the following commands:

		git add .
		git commit -m "changing to hello azure"
		git push azure master

	You are prompted for your password again.

3. Refresh the browser window that you navigated to the web app's URL.

## Next steps

You've deployed a Node.js application to a web app in Azure Websites. To learn more about how Azure Websites web apps run Node.js applications, see [Azure Websites: Node.js](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/silverlining/archive/2012/06/14/windows-azure-websites-node-js.aspx) and [Specifying a Node.js version in an Azure application](/documentation/articles/nodejs-specify-node-version-azure-apps).

Node.js provides a rich ecosystem of modules that can be used by your applications. To learn how Web Apps works with modules, see [Using Node.js modules with Azure applications](/documentation/articles/nodejs-use-node-modules-azure-apps).

If you encounter problems with your application after it has been deployed to Azure, see [How to debug a Node.js application in Azure Websites](/documentation/articles/web-sites-nodejs-debug) for information on diagnosing the problem.

This article uses the Azure Management Portal to create a web app. You can also use the [Azure Command-Line Interface](/documentation/articles/xplat-cli-install) or [Azure PowerShell](/documentation/articles/install-configure-powershell) to perform the same operations.
