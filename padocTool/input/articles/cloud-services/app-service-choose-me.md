# Should I Choose App Service?

Azure provides different hosting models for running applications. Each one provides a different set of services, so which one you choose depends on exactly what you're trying to do. Is App Service the choice for you?

| Compute Options    | Audience   |
| ------------------ | --------   |
| [App Service]      | Scalable Web Apps, Mobile Apps, API Apps, and Logic Apps for any device |
| [Cloud Services]   | Highly available, scalable n-tier cloud apps with more control of the OS |
| [Virtual Machines] | Customized Windows and Linux VMs with complete control of the OS |
