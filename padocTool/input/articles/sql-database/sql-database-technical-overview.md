# SQL Database Overview

SQL Database is a relational database service in the cloud based on the Microsoft SQL Server engine, with built-in, mission-critical capabilities. SQL Database delivers predictable performance, scalability, business continuity, data protection, and near-zero administration to cloud developers and solution architects. Best of all, SQL Database supports existing SQL Server tools, libraries and APIs, making it easy for you to move to the cloud. You can get a SQL Database [up and running within seconds](sql-database-get-started.md), without having to manage virtual machines or infrastructure. The programmatic DBA-like functionality enables efficient DevOps, and self-management ensures near-zero maintenance for the databases. This allows you to focus on developing and managing your application.

SQL Database allows you to [scale up](/documentation/articles/sql-database-service-tiers) single databases with no downtime and predictable performance that can be dialed up or down as needed, while you can choose [elastic databases](/documentation/articles/sql-database-elastic-pool) to scale out to thousands of databases within a budget that you control, leveraging the powerful manageability features of [elastic database jobs](sql-database-elastic-jobs-overview.md) and the programmatic features of [elastic database tools](/documentation/articles/sql-database-elastic-scale-get-started).

An industry leading 99.99% availability [SLA](/support/legal/sla/) helps ensure your applications face near-zero downtime. The built-in data protection via auditing, restore, and geo-replication helps ensure your data is protected. SQL Database provides you with the ability to restore your data to any point-in-time from any transaction up to 35 days. You can also replicate your data to an Azure region of your choice and easily implement a geographic disaster recovery policy designed for your business needs. The [latest version of SQL Database](/documentation/articles/sql-database-preview-whats-new), V12, provides nearly complete compatibility with the SQL Server engine.

SQL Database is available in Basic, Standard, and Premium [service tiers](/documentation/articles/sql-database-service-tiers) which support light-weight to heavy-weight database workloads, so you can move across or blend the tiers together for innovative application designs. With the power and reach of Azure, you can mix-and-match Azure services with SQL Database to meet your unique modern app design needs, drive cost and resource efficiencies, and unlock new business opportunities.

Get started with a [trial](/pricing/1rmb-trial/) and then [create your first SQL database](/documentation/articles/sql-database-get-started) in just a few minutes.
