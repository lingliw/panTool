# Oracle software hosted on Windows virtual machines in Azure

[AZURE.INCLUDE [virtual-machines-common-oracle-support](../../includes/virtual-machines-common-oracle-support.md)]

Set up your first or next dev/test or production Oracle database to run on a Windows virtual machine in Azure infrastructure services. Take advantage of ease of configuration and the ability to quickly expand the Oracle database workload to include new capacity. You can also set up Oracle software on [Linux virtual machines](/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-linux-classic-oracle/).

> [AZURE.IMPORTANT] Azure has two different deployment models for creating and working with resources:  [Resource Manager and classic](/documentation/articles/resource-manager-deployment-model/).  This article covers using the classic deployment model. Azure recommends that most new deployments use the Resource Manager model.
