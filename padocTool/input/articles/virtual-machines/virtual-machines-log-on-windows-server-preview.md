# How to log on to a virtual machine running Windows Server 

[AZURE.INCLUDE [learn-about-deployment-models](../includes/learn-about-deployment-models-include.md)] This article covers logging on to a Windows VM using Resource Manager deployment model. You can also create a resource with the [classic deployment model](/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-log-on-windows-server).

You'll use the **Connect** button in the Azure preview portal to start a Remote Desktop session. First you'll connect to the virtual machine, then you'll log on.

## Connect to the virtual machine

1. If you haven't already done so, sign in to the [Azure preview portal](https://manage.windowsazure.cn).

2.	On the Hub menu, click **Browse**.  

3.	On the search blade, scroll down and click **Virtual Machines**.
