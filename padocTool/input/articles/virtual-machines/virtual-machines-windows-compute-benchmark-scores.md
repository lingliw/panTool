# Compute benchmark scores for Windows VMs
The following SPECInt benchmark scores show compute performance for Azure's high-performance VM lineup running Windows Server. Compute benchmark scores are also available for [Linux VMs](/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-linux-compute-benchmark-scores/).

## About SPECint
Windows numbers were computed by running [SPECint 2006](https://www.spec.org/cpu2006/results/rint2006.html) on Windows Server. SPECint was run using the base rate option (SPECint_rate2006), with one copy per core. SPECint consists of 12 separate tests, each run three times, taking the median value from each test and weighting them to form a composite score. Those tests were then run across multiple VMs to provide the average scores shown.
