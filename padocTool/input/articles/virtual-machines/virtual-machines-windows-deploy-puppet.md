#About Puppet and Azure Virtual Machines

<p>Puppet Enterprise is automation software for building, deploying, and managing your infrastructure. You can use it to manage your IT infrastructure life-cycle, including discovery, provisioning, operating system and application configuration management, orchestration, and reporting.

Puppet is a client-server system. Puppet Master and the Puppet Enterprise Agent are both available for installation through Windows Azure:

- Puppet Master is available as a preconfigured image, installed on an Ubuntu server. You also can install Puppet Enterprise on an existing server, but using the image is the simplest way to get started. You'll need information about the server to set up the agent.

- Puppet Enterprise Agent is available as a virtual machine extension that you can install when you create a virtual machine, or install on an existing virtual machine.

For instructions, download the "Getting Started Guide"  from the [Microsoft Windows and Azure](http://puppetlabs.com/solutions/microsoft) page.
