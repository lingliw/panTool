# How to automate with Azure Resource Manager

> [AZURE.NOTE] Azure has two different deployment models for creating and working with resources:  [Resource Manager and classic](/documentation/articles/resource-manager-deployment-model/).  This article covers using the Resource Manager deployment model, which Azure recommends for most new deployments instead of the classic deployment model. You can't create this resource with the classic deployment model.

Azure Resource Manager simplifies the deployment and management of complex applications running on Azure infrastructure services. Many applications require a combination of compute, network, and storage resources, such as virtual network, Storage account, and virtual machines with network interfaces. Azure Resource Manager allows you to use or construct a JSON template to deploy and manage all these resources together as a single application.
