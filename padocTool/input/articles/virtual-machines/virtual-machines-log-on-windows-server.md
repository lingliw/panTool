# Log on to a Windows virtual machine created with the classic deployment model

[AZURE.INCLUDE [learn-about-deployment-models](../includes/learn-about-deployment-models-include.md)] This article covers managing resources with the classic deployment model.

You'll use the **Connect** button in the Azure preview portal to start a Remote Desktop session. First you'll connect to the virtual machine, then you'll log on.

Do you want to connect to a Linux VM? See [How to log on to a virtual machine running Linux](/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-linux-how-to-log-on).

Here's a walkthrough of the steps in this tutorial.


1. If you haven't already done so, sign in to the [Azure portal](http://manage.windowsazure.cn).
