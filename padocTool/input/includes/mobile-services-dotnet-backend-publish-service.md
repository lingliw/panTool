1. In Visual Studio, right-click the project, click **Publish** > **Windows Azure Mobile Services**. Instead of using Visual Studio, [you may also use Git](/documentation/articles/mobile-services/mobile-services-dotnet-backend-store-code-source-control).

2. Sign in with Azure credentials and select your service from **Existing Mobile Services**. Visual Studio downloads your publish settings directly from Azure. Finally, click **Publish**.
