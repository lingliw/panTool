## Create an Azure storage account

The easiest way to create your first Azure storage account is by using the [Azure Management Portal](https://manage.windowsazure.cn). To learn more, see [Create a storage account](/documentation/articles/storage-create-storage-account/#create-a-storage-account).

You can create an Azure storage account by using [Azure PowerShell](/documentation/articles/storage-powershell-guide-full/), [Azure CLI](/documentation/articles/storage-azure-cli/), the [Service Management REST API](http://msdn.microsoft.com/zh-cn/library/azure/ee460799.aspx) version 2014-10-01 or later (Classic deployments), or the [Azure Storage Resource Provider REST API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/zh-cn/library/azure/mt163683.aspx) (ARM deployments).

If you prefer not to create a storage account at this time, you can also use the Azure storage emulator to run and test your code in a local environment. For more information, see [Use the Azure Storage Emulator for Development and Testing](/documentation/articles/storage-use-emulator/).
