In this topic, you will create a new Mobile App backend, download and publish the server project, and download a "todo list" client app that connects to the new Mobile App backend. Mobile Apps provides you with all the backend functionality of Azure Websites, but with additional features designed for mobile developers, including offline sync and push notifications. Client SDKs simplify cloud-based data storage and authentication in your apps. For more information, see [What are Mobile Apps](/documentation/articles/app-service-mobile-value-prop).
