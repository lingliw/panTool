VNet Peering is a mechanism to connect two Virtual Networks in the same region through the Azure backbone network. Once peered, the two Virtual Networks will appear like a single Virtual Network for all connectivity purposes. Read the [VNet Peering overview](/documentation/articles/virtual-network-peering-overview/) if you are not familiar with VNet Peering.
