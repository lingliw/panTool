## Create a device identity
In this section, you use a Node tool called [IoT Hub Explorer][iot-hub-explorer] to create a device identity for this tutorial.

1. Run the following in your command-line environment:
   
    npm install -g iothub-explorer@latest
2. Then, run the following command to login to your hub, remembering to substitute `{service connection string}` with the IoT Hub connection string you previously copied:
   
    iothub-explorer login "{service connection string}"
3. Finally, create a new device identity called `myDeviceId` with the command:
   
    iothub-explorer create myDeviceId --connection-string

Make a note of the device connection string from the result. This connection string is used by the device app to connect to your IoT Hub as a device.
