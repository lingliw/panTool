## Azure portal and Azure Portal Preview
> [AZURE.IMPORTANT]
> The steps in this document use the Azure Portal Preview. Azure recommends using the Azure Portal Preview when creating new services. For an explanation of the advantages of the Portal Preview, see [DevOps just got a whole lot more awesome](https://azure.microsoft.comhttp://portal.azure.cn). 
> 
> Services and resources created in the Azure Portal Preview are not visible in the Azure portal, as they use a new resource model.
